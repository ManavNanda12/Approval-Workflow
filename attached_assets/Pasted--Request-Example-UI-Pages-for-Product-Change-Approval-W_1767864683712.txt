I need an **example HTML-based UI** to demonstrate a product change approval workflow. This is only for **visual and UX reference**, not functional backend integration.

---

## Page 1: Simple Product Selector Page

Create a **very simple list page** that contains:

* A list of product names with their IDs
  Example:

  * Product Name: *Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel* (ID: 1276)
  * Product Name: *Sample Product B* (ID: 1280)

### Behavior

* Each product name should be **clickable**
* On click, navigate to **Page 2 (Product Change List Page)**

This page is only meant to act as a **starting entry point**.

---

## Page 2: Product Change Requests – Product List View

This page shows a **list of products with change request summary information**.

### Table Columns

Each row represents one product and should include:

* Checkbox (at the start of the row)
* Product Name
* Total Items
* Pending Items
* Approved Items
* Rejected Items
* Needs Review (Yes / No)

### Bulk Action Rules

* Multiple products can be selected using checkboxes
* **Approve All / Reject All** actions should be enabled **only when**:

  * `PendingItems > 0`
  * `NeedsReview = false`
* If `NeedsReview = true`, bulk approve/reject should be disabled for that product

---

### Filters (Top of Page)

Add simple filters above the table:

* Filter by:

  * Needs Review = Yes / No
  * Pending Items > 0
* Optional: Search by product name

---

### Row Interaction

* Clicking on a **product row (or a View button)** should navigate to **Page 3 (Product Change Request Detail Page)**

---

## Page 3: Product Change Request Detail Page

This page is already **designed and finalized** (I will provide the design separately).

### Purpose

* Show field-level change details for a single product
* Allow:

  * Approve / Reject per field
  * Approve All Pending
  * Reject All Pending
* Display:

  * Current Value vs Proposed Value
  * Status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)

You can use the attached screenshot as the **visual reference** for this page.

---

## Notes

* This is a **static example UI** for demonstration only
* Dummy data is acceptable
* Focus on **layout, interaction flow, and clarity**
* No backend logic required
